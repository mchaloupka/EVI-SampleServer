EVI: Sample server
===================

Sample SPARQL endpoint using RDB2RDF mechanism based on R2RML mapping

How to use the SPARQL endpoint using a docker image
--------------------------------------------
There is an autobuild docker image from this repository. It represents the easiest way to run the SPARQL endpoint or to build a custom image.

To execute the image, you can use the following command:
```
docker run --rm -it \
    -v {...}:/mapping \
    -e EVI_STORAGE__MAPPINGFILEPATH=/mapping/mapping.ttl \
    -e EVI_STORAGE__CONNECTIONSTRING="Server=host.docker.internal,1433;Database=benchmark=;User Id=sa;Password=p@ssw0rd" \
    -p 5000:8080 \
    mchaloupka/slp.evi:latest
```
Where you replace `{...}` by the path to the folder where you have the mapping file `mapping.ttl`. The environment variables then declares where to find the mapping and which connection string to use.

Or you can create your own image based on `mchaloupka/slp.evi:latest`:
* Application is located in `app`
* Update `appsettings.json` to suit your needs
* Use the following entrypoint `ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet", "Slp.Evi.Endpoint.dll" ]` 

How to build the server and use it with your own database
--------------------------------------------
.NET Core SDK 3.1 is needed to build and run the endpoint.

In the repository you can find the `appsettings.json` file (in the Slp.Evi.Endpoint folder) where `ConnectionString` is configured. You can change it to anything you want. There is also `MappingFilePath` configuration where the path to the R2RML mapping file is configured.

To actually start the endpoint, you have to run `dotnet run` in the same folder. In the console you will see the address where the server is listening. It is a standard ASP.NET Core application, so you can use standard command line arguments to select the port etc.
